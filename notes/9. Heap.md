# Heap

A **Heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:

- In a **Max Heap**, for any given node, the value of the node is **greater than or equal to** the values of its children.
- In a **Min Heap**, for any given node, the value of the node is **less than or equal to** the values of its children.

Heaps are commonly implemented as **binary heaps**, which are complete binary trees.

## Key Concepts

- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
- **Heap Property**: Parent node is either greater (max heap) or smaller (min heap) than its children.
- **Root Node**: The maximum (max heap) or minimum (min heap) element of the heap.
- **Heapify**: Process of maintaining the heap property by shifting nodes up or down.
- **Priority Queue**: Abstract data type often implemented using heaps for efficient priority-based retrieval.

## Operations and Time Complexity

| Operation          | Time Complexity |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Insertion          | O(log n)        |
| Extract Max/Min    | O(log n)        |
| Peek (Get Max/Min) | O(1)            |
| Build Heap         | O(n)            |
| Search             | O(n)            |

---

## Common Operations

- **Insert**: Add element at the bottom, then "heapify up" to restore heap property.
- **Extract (Pop)**: Remove root, replace with last element, then "heapify down".
- **Heapify**: Reorganize heap to maintain heap property.
- **Build Heap**: Convert an arbitrary array into a heap using repeated heapify calls.

## Common Patterns / Problems

### 1. Kth Largest / Smallest Element
- Use a min-heap or max-heap of size k to track kth element efficiently.

### 2. Merge K Sorted Lists / Arrays
- Use a min-heap to efficiently merge multiple sorted sequences.

### 3. Top K Frequent Elements
- Use a heap to find elements with highest frequency.

### 4. Median in Data Stream
- Use two heaps (max-heap and min-heap) to maintain median dynamically.

| [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)           | Frequency + heap               |
| [Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)       | Two heaps (min and max heap)  |
| [Heap Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)                                   | Build heap + extract elements  |

## Tips & Tricks

- Visualize heap as an array: for node at index i,
  - Left child index = 2i + 1
  - Right child index = 2i + 2
  - Parent index = (i - 1) // 2
- Use built-in heap libraries when allowed (e.g., `heapq` in Python)
- Understand difference between min-heap and max-heap; invert values to simulate max-heap using min-heap if needed
- Remember that heap operations (insert, extract) are O(log n), making them efficient for priority-based problems
