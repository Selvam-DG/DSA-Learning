# Doubly Linked List 

A **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** is a type of linked list in which each node contains **three fields**:
- A **value** (data),
- A **pointer to the next node**,
- A **pointer to the previous node**.

This allows **bidirectional traversal** of the list.

---

##  Key Concepts

- **head** points to the first node
- **tail** points to the last node
- Every node has:
  - `prev` → pointer to the previous node
  - `next` → pointer to the next node

##  Time Complexity

| Operation               | Time Complexity |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Insert at head          | O(1)            |
| Insert at tail          | O(1)            |
| Insert at position      | O(n)            |
| Delete at head          | O(1)            |
| Delete at tail          | O(1)            |
| Delete at position      | O(n)            |
| Search for a value      | O(n)            |
| Forward/Backward traversal | O(n)         |

##  Operations

### 1. **Insertion**
- At head
- At tail
- At a specific position

### 2. **Deletion**
- From head
- From tail
- From a specific position

### 3. **Traversal**
- Forward (from head → tail)
- Backward (from tail → head)

##  Benefits Over Singly Linked List

- Can be traversed in both directions  
- Easier to delete a given node (with a pointer to it)  
- Requires extra space for `prev` pointer  
- Slightly more complex to implement

---

##  Key Use Cases

- **Undo/Redo** operations
- **Browser history**
- **MRU/LRU caches**
- **Text editor navigation**

##  Problems to Practice

| [LRU Cache (using DLL + HashMap)](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)       | DLL for recent usage order |
| [Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/) | Recursion with DLL         |

##  Tips & Tricks

- Be careful to update both `next` and `prev` pointers during insertion/deletion
- Use dummy `head` and `tail` nodes to simplify boundary operations
- LRU Cache is a very common use case – make sure you understand it!
