#  Asymptotic Notation
Asymptotic Notation is a mathematical way to describe the running time or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of input size (n). It helps us analyze how an algorithm performs as the input grows large.

## Why Asymptotic Notation?

To compare algorithms independently of hardware.

To focus on the growth rate rather than exact timing.

To ignore constants and lower-order terms.

### 1. Big O Notation – O(f(n))
** Worst-case** performance
- Describes the upper bound of an algorithm’s growth rate.
- Example:
  - Linear Search → `O(n)`
  - Merge Sort → `O(n log n)`

**Interpretation**: The algorithm takes at most *f(n)* time for large inputs.

### 2. Omega Notation – Ω(f(n))
**Best-case** performance
- Describes the lower bound of an algorithm’s growth rate.
- Example:
  - Linear Search (when element is first) → `Ω(1)`

**Interpretation**: The algorithm takes at least *f(n)* time.

### 3. Theta Notation – Θ(f(n))
**Average-case** (tight bound)

- Describes both upper and lower bounds—used when the algorithm has consistent performance.
- Example:
  - Binary Search → `Θ(log n)`

**Interpretation**: The algorithm always takes around *f(n)* time.

## Comparision Table | Notation | Meaning       | Bound Type  | Use Case     |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| O(f(n))  | At most f(n)  | Upper Bound | Worst Case   |
| Ω(f(n))  | At least f(n) | Lower Bound | Best Case    |
| Θ(f(n))  | Exactly f(n)  | Tight Bound | Average Case |

## Tips to Remember
- Use Big O for time complexity in interviews unless asked otherwise.
- Constants and small inputs don't matter in asymptotic analysis.
- Focus on the highest order term (e.g., `O(n² + n)` becomes `O(n²))`.
