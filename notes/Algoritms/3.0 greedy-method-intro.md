# Greedy Method – Introduction


## What is the Greedy Method?

A **greedy algorithm** builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the **locally optimal** option at each step, with the hope of finding a **global optimum**.

---

## Core Characteristics

- **Greedy Choice Property**: 
  A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a series of locally optimal choices.

- **Optimal Substructure**:  
  The optimal solution to the problem contains the optimal solution to subproblems.

- **No Backtracking**:
  Once a choice is made, it is never reconsidered.

## General Approach

1. Sort input data (if necessary)
2. Select the best choice based on a greedy criterion
3. Repeat until constraints are met or solution is complete

## Example Problems

| Problem Name                | Greedy Criterion                         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Activity Selection         | Earliest finish time                     |
| Fractional Knapsack        | Max value/weight ratio                   |
| Job Sequencing with Deadlines | Max profit before deadline           |
| Huffman Coding             | Minimum frequency nodes first            |
| Prim's MST Algorithm       | Minimum weight edge                      |
| Kruskal's MST Algorithm    | Minimum weight edge in acyclic set       |
| Dijkstra's Algorithm       | Minimum cost to reach next vertex        |

## Where It Fails

- Doesn’t work for all optimization problems (e.g., 0/1 Knapsack).
- Needs the problem to **satisfy greedy choice property** and **optimal substructure**.

---

## Time Complexity

- Usually between **O(n log n)** to **O(n²)** depending on:
  - Sorting (if needed)
  - Data structure used (e.g., priority queue for Dijkstra)

## Real-Life Applications

- Cashier change-making
- Scheduling problems
- Compression (Huffman encoding)
- Routing protocols
- Network design

## Summary

| Feature               | Greedy Method         |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Decision Basis         | Local Optimal          |
| Reconsider Decisions   |  No                  |
| Guarantee Optimality   | Only in some problems|
| Complexity             | Often better than DP   |
