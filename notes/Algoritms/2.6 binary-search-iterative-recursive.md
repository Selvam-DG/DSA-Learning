# Binary Search: Iterative and Recursive Methods

Binary Search is a **Divide and Conquer** algorithm used to search for a target value in a **sorted** array in `O(log n)` time.

---

## Binary Search Requirements
- The array must be sorted (ascending or descending order).
- The middle element is compared to the target.
- Based on the comparison, search either left or right half.

---

## Iterative Implementation (Python)

```python
def binary_search_iterative(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1  # Not found
```
**Example Usage**
```python
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
print(binary_search_iterative(arr, 7))  # Output: 3
```
### Recursive Implementation (Python)
```python
def binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Base case: not found

    mid = left + (right - left) // 2

    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, mid + 1, right)
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(arr, target, left, mid - 1)
```
**Example Usage**
```python
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(binary_search_recursive(arr, 8, 0, len(arr) - 1))  # Output: 3

```
### Time and Space Complexity

| Method    | Time Complexity | Space Complexity                |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Iterative | O(log n)        | O(1)                            |
| Recursive | O(log n)        | O(log n) due to recursive stack |


### Notes
- Both methods perform the same number of comparisons.
- Iterative is usually preferred in environments where stack space is limited.
- Recursive is cleaner and easier to understand for many learners.
