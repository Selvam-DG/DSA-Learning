# Job Sequencing with Deadlines – Greedy Method

---

## Problem Statement

You are given:
- `n` jobs, each with:
  - **Deadline** (`d[i]`)
  - **Profit** (`p[i]`)
- Each job takes exactly **1 unit of time** to complete.
- Only **one job can be scheduled at a time**.
- A job earns profit **only if completed before or on its deadline**.

### Goal:
Maximize total profit while scheduling jobs.

---

## Greedy Approach

**Greedy Criterion**:  
- Schedule jobs with **highest profit first**.
- Assign each job to the **latest possible time slot** before its deadline (if available).

---

## Algorithm Steps

1. Sort jobs by **descending profit**.
2. Initialize a time slot array to keep track of occupied slots.
3. For each job in sorted order:
   - Find the latest available slot on or before its deadline.
   - If found, schedule the job in that slot and add its profit.

## Python Implementation

```python
class Job:
    def __init__(self, job_id, deadline, profit):
        self.id = job_id
        self.deadline = deadline
        self.profit = profit

def job_sequencing(jobs):
    # Step 1: Sort jobs by decreasing profit
    jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x.profit, reverse=True)

    # Find max deadline to determine slot size
    max_deadline = max(job.deadline for job in jobs)
    slots = [-1] * (max_deadline + 1)  # Using index 1..max_deadline
    total_profit = 0
    job_order = []

    # Step 2: Schedule jobs
    for job in jobs:
        for t in range(job.deadline, 0, -1):  # Latest possible slot
            if slots[t] == -1:
                slots[t] = job.id
                total_profit += job.profit
                job_order.append(job.id)
                break

    return job_order, total_profit

# Example Usage
jobs = [
    Job('J1', 2, 100),
    Job('J2', 1, 19),
    Job('J3', 2, 27),
    Job('J4', 1, 25),
    Job('J5', 3, 15)
]

order, profit = job_sequencing(jobs)
print("Scheduled Jobs:", order)
print("Total Profit:", profit)
```

###  Example
**Input:**
| Job | Deadline | Profit |
| --- | -------- | ------ |
| J1  | 2        | 100    |
| J2  | 1        | 19     |
| J3  | 2        | 27     |
| J4  | 1        | 25     |
| J5  | 3        | 15     |

**Sorted by Profit:**

| Job | Deadline | Profit |
| --- | -------- | ------ |
| J1  | 2        | 100    |
| J3  | 2        | 27     |
| J4  | 1        | 25     |
| J2  | 1        | 19     |
| J5  | 3        | 15     |

**Schedule:**
| Time Slot | Job |
| --------- | --- |
| 1         | J3  |
| 2         | J1  |
| 3         | J5  |

**Output:**

- Scheduled Jobs: `[J3, J1, J5]`
- Total Profit: 142
---

## Time Complexity
- Sorting: `O(n log n)`
- Scheduling:`O(n * max_deadline)`
- Total: ≈ `O(n log n + n * max_deadline)`

---

### Notes
- This approach assumes job durations are equal.
- Works well when the number of available slots ≤ number of jobs.
