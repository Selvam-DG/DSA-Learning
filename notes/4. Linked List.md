#  Linked List 

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. Each node points to the next node, forming a chain.

---

##  Key Concepts

- Each **node** contains:
  - **Data** (value)
  - **Pointer** (reference to the next node)
- **Head** points to the first node
- **Tail** is the last node (points to null)
- Types:
  - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points only to the next node
  - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes have pointers to both next and previous nodes
  - **Circular Linked List**: Last node points back to head

##  Time Complexity

| Operation                | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Access by index          | O(n)               | O(n)               |
| Insertion at head        | O(1)               | O(1)               |
| Insertion at tail        | O(n)               | O(1) (if tail pointer maintained) |
| Deletion at head         | O(1)               | O(1)               |
| Deletion at tail         | O(n)               | O(1) (if tail pointer maintained) |
| Search                   | O(n)               | O(n)               |

##  Common Operations

- **Traversal**: Visit nodes sequentially
- **Insertion**: At head, tail, or specific position
- **Deletion**: Remove node by value or position
- **Reversal**: Reverse the linked list

##  Common Patterns / Problems

### 1. Slow and Fast Pointers (Tortoise and Hare)
- Detect cycle in linked list
- Find middle element

### 2. Reversing Linked List
- Iterative and recursive approaches

### 3. Merging Two Sorted Linked Lists
- Classic merging like merge in merge sort

### 4. Remove N-th Node from End
- Use two pointers with offset

##  Tips & Tricks

- Remember to handle edge cases: empty list, single node list
- Always update pointers carefully to avoid losing nodes
- Use dummy nodes to simplify insertion/deletion logic
- Visualize pointer changes when practicing

## Implementation
``` python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, value=None, next = None):
    self.value = value
    self.next = next

class LinkedList:
  def __init__(self, head):
    self.head = None

```
