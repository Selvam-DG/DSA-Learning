# Trees

A **Tree** is a hierarchical non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has one root node and zero or more child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship.

## Key Concepts

- **Root**: The topmost node of the tree.
- **Node**: Element containing data and references to child nodes.
- **Edge**: Connection between two nodes.
- **Leaf Node**: Node with no children.
- **Height**: Number of edges in longest path from root to a leaf.
- **Depth**: Number of edges from root to a given node.
- **Subtree**: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.

## Types of Trees

- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children (left and right).
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Binary tree where left child < parent < right child.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same depth.
- **Balanced Tree**: Height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1 (e.g., AVL tree, Red-Black tree).
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Tree for storing strings where each node represents a character.

## Tree Traversals

### Depth First Search (DFS)

- **Inorder (Left → Root → Right)**: Used in BSTs to get sorted output.
- **Preorder (Root → Left → Right)**: Used to copy the tree or get prefix expression.
- **Postorder (Left → Right → Root)**: Used to delete tree or get postfix expression.

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

- **Level Order Traversal**: Traverse nodes level by level using a queue.

## Time Complexity

| Operation          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity          |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| DFS Traversals      | O(n)            | O(h) where h = tree height (recursion stack) |
| BFS Traversal       | O(n)            | O(w) where w = max width of the tree (queue) |
| Search/Insert/Delete (BST, avg) | O(log n)     | O(h)                     |
| Search/Insert/Delete (BST, worst) | O(n)         | O(h)                     |

## Tips & Tricks

- Use recursion to simplify DFS traversals.
- Use a queue for BFS level order traversal.
- Inorder traversal of BST returns sorted elements.
- Postorder traversal useful for operations needing child results first (e.g., computing height).
- Keep track of height or depth with recursion.
- Use dummy nodes or parent pointers if necessary.
