#  Dictionaries / Hash Maps 

A **Hash Map** (called **Dictionary** in Python) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It allows **fast lookup, insertion, and deletion** using the key.

---

##  Key Concepts

- **Key-value** storage: `{ key1: value1, key2: value2 }`
- Implemented using a **hashing function** to map keys to indices in an array
- Keys must be **immutable** (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples)

##  Time Complexity

| Operation    | Average Case | Worst Case (with collisions) |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Insert       | O(1)         | O(n)                          |
| Delete       | O(1)         | O(n)                          |
| Search/Get   | O(1)         | O(n)                          |

In practice, Python dictionaries are very efficient and usually provide **O(1)** time.

##  Common Use Cases

- Counting frequencies of elements
- Checking for duplicates
- Storing mappings (like key → value, node → neighbors)
- Caching results (Memoization)
- Grouping data by keys

| [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) | Sliding window + hashmap      |
| [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)                  | Frequency counting             |

## Tips & Tricks

- When checking for duplicates: use `if x in hashmap`
- For counting: use `collections.Counter` or a default dictionary
- To track indices or frequency: store values as lists or integers
- Tuples can be keys; lists cannot (mutable types are not hashable)
- Hash maps are also the foundation of **sets** (set is like a dict with only keys)

##  Python Syntax Cheatsheet

```python
# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# Inserting / Updating
my_dict['c'] = 3

# Accessing
val = my_dict['a']       # KeyError if not exists
val = my_dict.get('x', 0)  # Returns 0 if 'x' not in dict

# Checking existence
if 'a' in my_dict:
    print('Yes')

# Deleting
del my_dict['b']

# Iterating
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```
