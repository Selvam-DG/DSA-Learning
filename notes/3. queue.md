#  Queue 

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle.

---

##  Key Concepts

- Elements are added from the **rear (tail)** and removed from the **front (head)**.
- Basic operations:
  - **enqueue(x)**: Add element `x` to the rear
  - **dequeue()**: Remove and return the front element
  - **peek/front()**: Return the front element without removing it
  - **isEmpty()**: Check if queue is empty

---

##  Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| enqueue   | O(1)            |
| dequeue   | O(1)            |
| peek/front| O(1)            |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            |

##  Variants of Queue

- **Simple Queue**: Basic FIFO
- **Circular Queue**: Rear connects back to front to utilize space efficiently
- **Priority Queue**: Elements are dequeued based on priority, not order
- **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: Insert/delete from both ends

---

##  Common Use Cases / Patterns

### 1. Level Order Traversal (BFS) in Trees and Graphs
- Explore nodes level by level using a queue

### 2. Sliding Window Problems
- Maintain a window of elements with efficient insertions and deletions

### 3. Scheduling and Resource Management
- Simulate tasks in order (e.g., CPU task scheduling)

### 4. Implementing Cache (LRU Cache often uses queue + hashmap)

## Tips & Tricks

- Use a queue to maintain order when traversing levels or processing tasks
- Circular queues solve space wastage problems in fixed-size arrays
- Priority queues are great for problems requiring dynamic ordering
- When implementing BFS, use a queue to track nodes to visit next
