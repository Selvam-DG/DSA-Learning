# Graph

A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of a set of nodes (called vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can represent networks like social connections, maps, or communication networks.

## Key Concepts

- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Fundamental units/entities in the graph
- **Edges**: Connections between vertices
- Types of graphs:
  - **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have direction (from one vertex to another)
  - **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction (bi-directional)
  - **Weighted Graph**: Edges carry weights/costs
  - **Unweighted Graph**: Edges have no weights
  - **Cyclic Graph**: Contains at least one cycle
  - **Acyclic Graph**: No cycles
  - **Connected Graph**: Every vertex reachable from every other vertex (in undirected)
  - **Disconnected Graph**: Some vertices are not reachable from others

## Graph Representations

- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array where `matrix[i][j]` indicates edge presence/weight
- **Adjacency List**: Array or list where each vertex points to a list of neighbors
- **Edge List**: List of edges as pairs (or triples if weighted)

## Time Complexity

| Operation                        | Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List  |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Check if edge exists             | O(1)             | O(V) or O(E)    |
| Add edge                        | O(1)             | O(1)            |
| Remove edge                    | O(1)             | O(V) or O(E)    |
| Iterate over neighbors          | O(V)             | O(degree of vertex) |

*(V = number of vertices, E = number of edges)*

## Common Graph Traversal Algorithms

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores graph level by level using a queue
- Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as far as possible along each branch using recursion or stack
- Useful for cycle detection, topological sorting

---

## Common Patterns / Problems

### 1. Cycle Detection
- Detect cycles in directed/undirected graphs using DFS or Union-Find

### 2. Topological Sorting
- Order vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

### 3. Shortest Path
- BFS for unweighted graphs
- Dijkstra’s algorithm for weighted graphs with non-negative weights
- Bellman-Ford for graphs with negative weights

### 4. Connected Components
- Find isolated subgraphs in an undirected graph

### 5. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Find subset of edges connecting all vertices with minimum total weight (Kruskal’s, Prim’s algorithms)

## Tips & Tricks

- Choose adjacency list for sparse graphs, adjacency matrix for dense graphs
- Use BFS for shortest paths in unweighted graphs
- Use DFS recursion carefully to avoid stack overflow (consider iterative DFS)
- Use visited sets or arrays to avoid revisiting nodes
- For directed graphs, track recursion stack to detect cycles
