#  Stack 

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.

---

##  Key Concepts

- Elements are added and removed from the **top** of the stack.
- Basic operations:
  - **push(x)**: Add element `x` to the top
  - **pop()**: Remove and return the top element
  - **peek() / top()**: Return the top element without removing it
  - **isEmpty()**: Check if stack is empty

##  Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| push      | O(1)            |
| pop       | O(1)            |
| peek/top  | O(1)            |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            |

##  Common Use Cases / Patterns

### 1. Expression Evaluation / Parsing
- Infix to postfix conversion
- Valid parentheses matching
- Evaluate postfix expressions

### 2. Backtracking
- DFS implementation uses stacks (explicit or via recursion)

### 3. Undo Functionality
- Track user actions to revert operations

### 4. Maintaining Previous State
- Stock span problem, histogram largest rectangle

##  Important Problems to Practice

| Problem                                              | Key Concept        |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)       | Stack + String parsing |
| [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)                       | Stack with auxiliary data structure |
| [Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/) | Stack-based evaluation |
| [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)     | Monotonic stack    |
| [Next Greater Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/) | Stack for next greater |

##  Tips & Tricks

- Use a stack to keep track of indices when the problem involves "next greater/smaller" elements.
- Keep an auxiliary stack if you need to maintain additional info (e.g., min stack).
- For recursion-heavy problems, try converting recursion to stack for better control.
- Always check for empty stack before popping or peeking.
