# ðŸ“‚ Arrays - Notes

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. They store elements in contiguous memory locations and allow random access via indexing.

---

##  Key Concepts

- **Definition**: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Access Time**: O(1) using index
- **Insertion/Deletion**: O(n) (due to shifting of elements)
- **Fixed size** in most programming languages (Python lists are dynamic)

##  Common Operations

| Operation         | Time Complexity |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Access by index  | O(1)            |
| Search (unsorted)| O(n)            |
| Search (sorted)  | O(log n) with binary search |
| Insert/Delete at end | O(1) / O(n)  |
| Insert/Delete at beginning/middle | O(n) |

##  Common Patterns

### 1. Two Pointers
Used when array is sorted or needs scanning from both ends.
- Example: `Two Sum II`, `Valid Palindrome`, `Container With Most Water`

### 2. Sliding Window
For problems involving subarrays or sequences.
- Example: `Maximum Subarray`, `Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters`

### 3. Prefix Sum
For fast range sum queries.
- Example: `Subarray Sum Equals K`, `Find Pivot Index`

### 4. Hashing with Arrays
To reduce time complexity by storing values in a map.
- Example: `Two Sum`, `Majority Element`

##  Important Tips

- Python lists are dynamic, but watch out for time complexity when using `.insert()` or `.remove()`
- Watch for **out-of-bound errors**
- Pay attention to **0-based indexing**
- Always check edge cases like empty arrays or single-element arrays
