# DSA-Learning


This repo is my personal journey through mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** by solving problems, taking notes, and building small projects. It includes my solutions to popular coding challenges from platforms like **LeetCode** and **NeetCode**, along with organized notes and resources.

## DSA Study Plan

>  Goal: To prepare for coding interviews and build a strong foundation in algorithms.

-  Solve 3â€“5 problems daily
-  Add notes after completing each major topic
-  Build small projects to apply what I learn
-  Revisit tricky problems and note patterns
